### This application uses a machine learning regression model to estimate the market value of a house based on key property features

### The dataset used in this project is designed for beginners learning regression. It contains 1000 rows, where each row represents a house and multiple attributes that influence its price

### This makes the project ideal for practicing basic to intermediate-level regression modeling techniques using real-world–style data
